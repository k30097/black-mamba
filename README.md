# black-mamba
RESTful Flask API written in Python. 
Developed as Final project for my BSc (Hons) Cybersecurity and Networks

The app performs nmap scans, dirbuster attacks and it identifies vulnerable tags in HTML pages.

If running the app on a Windows machine make sure that Nmap is installed and added to path.
